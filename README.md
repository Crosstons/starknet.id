## What is Starknet.ID?

Starknet.ID is an identity provider on Starknet. The protocol allows you to create your Starknet Identity (that can be seen as your on-chain passport) and to attach things to it. You can already you can register ".stark" human-readable domains that will be used as your Starknet username.

## The Grand Vision

The grand vision behind starknet.id is that someday, in a society where web3 has permeated the mainstream, a person’s starknet.id can provide a reliable and comprehensive “digital identity”, in contrast to the unreliable self-issued credentials that we decorate our LinkedIn pages and job resumes with.

Currently, we want to focus on the starknet ecosystem, our goal is to build a decentralized identity service that can be used by all the starknet protocols as an on-chain profile where you can find all the information concerning a person's identity on Starknet.

**Let’s take an example :**
The developer bobby.stark contributes to the starknet ecosystem by writing some useful code.

To reward him the foundation can give him money, but can also give him a SBT (non-transferrable NFT) that proves that his work was a success. This SBT could then act as reference on his digital resume for him to find jobs on other starknet projects.

It works with dev contributions but the possibilities are endless :

🎓**Education:** Those who cannot afford an expensive university degree can prove their educational credentials through SBTs displayed on their starknet.id and obtained from avenues of informal learning.

🏛️**Banking:** Loan applicants can prove their trustworthiness through the absence of bad credit history, or by showcasing their good reputation through an SBT collection, removing the need for capital-inefficient overcollaterization models commonly used in DeFi (Upon repayment of the loan, another SBT could be issued as proof of repayment).

🎟️**Governance:** DAOs can improve their collective decision-making systems by safeguarding against whales (you can’t buy a SBT). DAOs can also avert a tyranny of the majority consensus through a more inclusive voting system design by issuing SBTs to trusted outsiders.
